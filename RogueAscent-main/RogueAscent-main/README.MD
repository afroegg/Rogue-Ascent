    - etc...
- [ ] Add keybindings config (could use dictionaries for this)
- [ ] Find ways to generate the level:
    - create using tile mapping
    - utilize .csv for saving these tiles
    - for example:
        - a m by n grid with values ranging 0 - k
        - where i is the value at a cell with index x and y
        - [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]
        - [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]
        - [ 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 ]
